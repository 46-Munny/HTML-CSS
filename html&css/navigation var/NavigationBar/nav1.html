      <p>Every programmer has a story about how they learned to write their first program. Mine is quite simple. As my sister studied CSE in Jahangirnagar University, I learned my first code from her. Whereas, most of the programmers’ first program is printing ‘Hello World’, mine was printing “Munny is a bad girl.” I learned C for the first time. I learned basic C and HTML 5 within 2018. But I don’t wanna be a ‘jack of all but master of none’. So, I decided to learn Python to the deepest. And now my journey begins with the book ‘Python Crash Course’. Let’s see where it takes me.
 
Part- I
“BASICS”
Chapter One: Getting Started

 	Python On Windows:
1.	To check if Python is already installed-
Open a command window by entering command in the Start Menu or by Shift+Right Mouse Button > Open Command Window Here.
2.	>>> is called Python prompt
3.	If Python isn’t installed yet go to:
https://python.org>Downloads>click download
4.	Select add python to path.

 	Code Python In The Terminal:
Input-
	$python
Or,
	$python3
			To Check Python Version Use The Following Command-
				$python --version
